## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox Css

### Time required

It took me nearly the hold day to complete the small challenge.

### What I learned

This is the css design code snippet of the media queries section, through which i got more clear on screen sizes break points.

```css
@media (max-width: 59em) {
  html {
    font-size: 50%;
  }
  .grid--2-cols {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
  .heading-secondary {
    margin-top: 4.6rem;
    padding-top: 2.4rem;
  }
  .left-heading-image .cookie-image {
    position: absolute;
    left: -8rem;
    bottom: -4.7rem;
  }
  .left-heading-image .cookie-image img {
    width: 90%;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I have still a lot to grab on positioning elements. The breakpoints of media queries still need to be smooth.
